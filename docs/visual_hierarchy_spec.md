# Visual Hierarchy Enhancement Specification

## Overview
Restructure the landing page visual strategy to create clear visual hierarchy with distinct, thematically appropriate animations for each section. Remove competing visual elements and strengthen the most impactful placements.

## Section-by-Section Visual Strategy

### 1. Hero Section - Knowledge Network Focus

#### **Enhanced Network Animation**
Since this is now the primary visual element, make it more prominent:

```typescript
// Enhanced config for hero section
const heroNetworkConfig = {
  particleCount: 120, // Increased from 80
  particleSize: 4, // Larger particles  
  maxConnectionDistance: 150, // Wider connections
  connectionOpacity: 0.9, // Much more visible
  pulseStrength: 0.4, // More dramatic breathing
  
  // Hero-specific enhancements
  networkGrowthRate: 0.02, // Nodes gradually cluster over time
  connectionPersistence: 0.7, // Connections stay longer
  centralGravity: 0.001, // Slight pull toward center
  
  // Visual enhancements
  connectionGlow: true, // Add subtle glow effect
  nodeHierarchy: true, // Some nodes become "hubs" 
  colorEvolution: true // Colors shift as networks mature
}
```

#### **Network Behavior Enhancements**
- **Central clustering tendency** - nodes gradually drift toward screen center
- **Hub formation** - some nodes become larger "knowledge centers" 
- **Connection persistence** - once connected, relationships last longer
- **Organic pulsing** - connected nodes pulse in sync occasionally
- **Growth over time** - network density increases subtly during user session

#### **Implementation Changes**
```css
.hero-network-canvas {
  opacity: 0.8; /* More prominent than before */
  z-index: 1; /* Above background, below text */
}

.hero-content {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 10;
  /* Ensure text remains readable over enhanced network */
}
```

### 2. Truth-Driven Development Section - Pixelated Farm Assets

#### **Visual Design Requirements**
Replace the current three simple cards with rich, pixelated farm landscapes:

**Card Dimensions**: 400px × 300px (larger than current)
**Pixel Resolution**: 8px grid for authentic retro feel
**Color Palette**: Earth tones matching brand (#22c55e, #16a34a, #a3a3a3, #525252)

#### **Three Distinct Farm Landscapes**

##### **Card 1: Shared Epistemology - "Community Farm Network"**
```
Visual Elements:
- Multiple connected farm plots showing cooperation
- Shared irrigation systems flowing between properties  
- Farmers working together in adjacent fields
- Visual data streams connecting different farms
- Community barn/storage facility in center
- Birds-eye view showing interconnected systems

Technology Integration:
- Shared weather monitoring stations
- Connected farming equipment
- Community knowledge sharing (visual thought bubbles)
- Network lines showing information flow

Farming Metaphor: "Knowledge flows like water through community channels"
```

##### **Card 2: Individual Growth - "Seasonal Progression"** 
```
Visual Elements:
- Single farm plot showing growth over time
- Split-screen: seedling → mature crop → harvest
- Farmer tending plants at different growth stages
- Personal greenhouse/workspace
- Tools and equipment for individual cultivation
- Progress indicators (growth charts, calendars)

Technology Integration:
- Personal AI farming assistant (small robot/drone)
- Individual monitoring sensors
- Growth tracking displays
- Personal knowledge garden

Farming Metaphor: "Individual potential cultivated through dedicated attention"
```

##### **Card 3: Transparent Systems - "Root Networks"**
```
Visual Elements:
- Cross-section cutaway view of farm operations
- Underground root systems visible
- Clear water/nutrient flow paths
- Transparent buildings showing internal operations
- Open data displays and monitoring systems
- Supply chain visualization from seed to market

Technology Integration:
- Blockchain tracking systems (visual chain links)
- Transparent financial flows
- Open-source farming data
- Community-visible decision making processes

Farming Metaphor: "Truth grows from visible foundations"
```

#### **Asset Creation Specifications**

##### **Technical Requirements**
```
Resolution: 400×300px at 2x (800×600px source)
Pixel Grid: 8px squares for authentic pixelation
Color Depth: 8-12 colors maximum per asset
File Format: PNG with transparency
Animation: Subtle micro-animations (optional)
- Gentle wind swaying crops
- Flowing water in irrigation
- Twinkling data points
```

##### **Design System**
```css
.truth-driven-cards {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
  margin: 3rem 0;
}

.farm-landscape-card {
  position: relative;
  border: 4px solid #1c1917;
  background: #f5f5f4;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  min-height: 400px; /* Increased from standard card */
}

.farm-landscape-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
  image-rendering: pixelated; /* Preserve pixel art clarity */
  image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges;
  image-rendering: crisp-edges;
}

.farm-card-content {
  padding: 1.5rem;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);
}
```

### 3. Product Section - Selective Network Animation

#### **TruthExchange Card Enhancement**
Only the TruthExchange product card gets the knowledge network background:

```typescript
// Reduced network for product card
const productNetworkConfig = {
  particleCount: 40, // Fewer particles
  particleSize: 3,
  maxConnectionDistance: 100,
  connectionOpacity: 0.6,
  focusedClustering: true, // More intentional clustering
  businessTheme: true // Slightly more structured movement
}
```

#### **Garden & Seurat Cards**
Clean, static illustrations:
- **Garden**: Simple book/newsletter icon with growth elements
- **Seurat**: Abstract representation of human potential/coaching

### 4. Implementation Strategy

#### **Phase 1: Network Enhancement (Immediate)**
```bash
# Enhance hero network animation
1. Update TruthExchangeNetwork class with hero-specific config
2. Add network growth and persistence features  
3. Implement connection glow effects
4. Add hub node behavior
5. Increase opacity and prominence
```

#### **Phase 2: Farm Asset Creation**
```bash
# Create pixelated farm landscapes
1. Generate base concepts using AI (Midjourney/DALL-E)
2. Refine in Aseprite for pixel-perfect execution
3. Export at proper resolutions with transparency
4. Optimize for web delivery
5. Create fallback static versions
```

#### **Phase 3: Integration & Polish**
```bash
# Integrate new assets into Truth-Driven Development section
1. Update card layout for larger dimensions
2. Implement image-rendering CSS for pixel art
3. Add subtle hover animations (optional)
4. Ensure responsive behavior
5. Add loading states and fallbacks
```

## Performance Considerations

### **Network Animation Optimizations**
- **Intersection Observer**: Only animate hero network when visible
- **Reduced motion**: Respect user preferences
- **Mobile optimization**: Fewer particles on smaller screens
- **Battery optimization**: Pause during low battery

### **Farm Asset Optimizations**  
- **WebP format** with PNG fallbacks
- **Lazy loading** for below-fold images
- **Responsive images** with appropriate sizing
- **Compression optimization** while preserving pixel art quality

## Accessibility & UX

### **Motion Sensitivity**
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .hero-network-canvas {
    display: none;
  }
  
  .farm-landscape-card {
    /* Show static versions only */
  }
}
```

### **Screen Reader Support**
```html
<div class="farm-landscape-card" role="img" aria-label="Pixelated farm showing community cooperation through shared irrigation systems">
  <!-- Visual content -->
</div>
```

### **Loading States**
```css
.farm-landscape-loading {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #f0f0f0 25%, #e0e0e0 50%, #f0f0f0 75%);
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  animation: loading 1.5s infinite;
}
```

## Success Metrics
